# Kilkimi Whiskies Online Store

Maker has expanded and is now selling Scotch whiskies online, under the trading name Kilkimi Whiskies.

## Requirements

You have been engaged to build a simple website/system of your choice that users can add items to, calculate and display the total items and price.

It’s important to demonstrate in your solution the following:

- A clear frontend and backend separation of tasks.
- Any appropriate automated tests.
- Any considerations that in the future, someone else may be working on your code and changing or extending it.

## Current Inventory

The items that Kilkimi Whiskies currently carries are as follows:

| SKU  | Name                        | Price ($) |
|------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| DEAN | Deanston 12 years old       | 99.99     |
| KIL  | Kilkerran 12 years old      | 89.99     |
| ARR  | Arran 10 years old          | 79.99     |
| JOHN | Johnnie Walker Green Label  | 75.99     |

## Special Pricing Rules

These are some of our current promotions:

- **Johnnie Walker Green Label** has a 4-for-3 offer; if you buy four bottles, you only pay for three.
- **Kilkerran 12 years old** has a one bottle per order limit.
- **Arran 10 years old** has a bulk buy special; if you buy 12 bottles, the price per bottle drops to $75 each.
- If the total order exceeds $500, one free bottle of **Deanston 12 years old** is given for free.

## Notes

- Use React for the frontend, and PHP for the backend programming languages. If possible, do not use any frameworks for PHP.
- Approach this any way you like that may showcase your approach to development. If necessary, justify your chosen approach.
- Do not spend more than a few hours on this, or however much time you want to put into it; it is OK to submit a partially finished code – we just want to get an idea of your coding logic and style.
- Please put your code up in a git repository that we can clone from (we can supply a public key if needed). Commit along the way, so that we may see your thinking process.
- Have fun! Don’t stress out on this!
